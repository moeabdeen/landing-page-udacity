# Landing Page Project
This project is for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree program. HTML and CSS starter code provided by Udacity.
## Description
This project involves creating a landing page that uses JS to create a dynamic navbar and to highlight sections when scrolled. The project uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.


## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. I had to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JS file.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
